Some days, Ebola broke loose before the facts did. Monkeypox whispers turned loud after the streets had already paid in skin. Scientists asked for data. The data asked for time. The system answered with silence.

That can’t keep happening.

**Afroinformatics** is for everyone who sat in a lab and stared at a screen that couldn't speak their language.
For students copying datasets they barely understood.
For researchers collecting samples with no tools to process them.
For the curious. The restless. The tired-of-waiting.

We’re making tools. Small, maybe. But ours.

---

No fancy words. No big promises.
Just code that works. Or tries to.
And documentation that tells the truth.

You’ll see folders like:

* `bio-tools`: FASTA readers. GC content. Sequence crunchers.
* `health-dashboard`: Maps that tell you *where it hurts* — and who’s been counting.
* `agro-tools`: Data that talks to farmers, not just academics.
* `datasets`: Files from Africa, **for** Africa. No paywalls. No mystery.

We aren’t chasing buzzwords. We’re building bricks.
One block. Then another.

No launch party. Just work.

---

If you code, help.
If you teach, guide.
If you observe, comment.

No gatekeeping. No godfathers. Just GitHub.

**Afroinformatics**
From here.
Built here.
Used here.

That’s it.
